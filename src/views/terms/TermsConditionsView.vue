					The Jenny Craig Plan is a portion-controlled, reduced-calorie comprehensive weight loss plan. You are urged and advised to seek the advice of a health care provider before beginning the Jenny Craig Plan, or any other weight loss plan as changing your diet or exercise, or losing weight, may affect some medical conditions and medications. Your health care provider may need to adjust your medications due to changes in your diet, exercise, or weight while on this plan.
				</p> <p class="mb-3">
					The Jenny Craig Plan will provide a suggested calorie range to promote a healthy weight and is designed for a safe rate of weight loss of 1 to 2 lbs. per week. Since weight loss varies with individuals, including starting weight and adherence to the Jenny Craig Plan, we do not guarantee weight loss results. It is important to note that medical studies indicated that people 20 percent or more above their recommended weight are at an increased risk of many illnesses or diseases. It is also important to be aware of certain risks that have been associated with weight loss and that possible side effects may occur. You should consult with your health care provider before starting and while on the Jenny Craig Plan to understand the possible side effects of weight loss.
					<strong>Please be sure to eat all the food that is recommended on the Jenny Craig Plan. Failure to follow the Jenny Craig Plan protocol and eat all the food recommended may increase the risk of developing serious health complications.</strong></p> <p class="mb-3">
