                    <p>All information collected by us is maintained in a reasonable manner and pursuant to applicable law. The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with those who access or use our websites and the services they offer is
                        of utmost concern to us. We employ commercially reasonable physical, technological, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Information using industry standard technology. Your Personal Information resides on a secure server
                        that only selected JCR Holdings II employees and contractors have access to via password. In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing
                        agents and distribution institutions that employ appropriate security safeguards. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.</p>

                        limitations of the internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our websites cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information
                        and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on our website(s), it is your responsibility to safeguard them and utilize strong, complex
                        passwords. If you have a user account on any of our websites, you agree to maintain the confidentiality of your account details and notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach relating to

                    <p>The Jenny Craig mobile messaging service (the “Service”) is offered through a third-party partner. We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. From time to time, we may make mobile device applications and mobile
                        marketing campaigns available to you and may allow you to register for services that involve push notifications and/or emails being sent to your mobile Device. You agree to receive recurring automated promotional and personalized marketing
                        text (e.g., SMS and MMS) messages (e.g. cart reminders) from Jenny Craig to the mobile telephone number you provided when signing up or any other number that you designate. Consent to receive automated marketing text messages is not a
                        condition of any purchase. Message frequency varies. Msg &amp; Data rates may apply. Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending text message or e-mail from your mobile Device to us or a third-party campaign operator. An autodialed
                        text message, e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile Device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. Your consent to receive marketing text messages is not a condition of any purchase, and you may opt
                        out at any time.</p>
                    <p>If your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list, but you then opt-in to our Service, then you are agreeing to receive text messages and supersede your prior decision to be placed on the Do Not Call list.</p>
                    <p>Promotional messages on shortcodes 98096 and 46310 are recurring messages. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile Device services. Such access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime
                        charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications, delivery of the messages, emails or other materials to your mobile Device. Please consult your mobile service provider's
                        pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving push notifications or emails from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity
                        to opt-in to receive push notifications or emails to your mobile Device at the time you register for the campaign and with each message or email you receive. To stop receiving text messages, text “STOP” to our shortcode by responding to
                        any text message received from us. After you send the SMS message “STOP” to us, we will send you an SMS message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. If you want to join
                        again, just re-subscribe in the same manner that you previously used to sign up. If you have subscribed to other Jenny Craig mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt
                        out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.</p>
                    <p>We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone
                        number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.</p>
                    <p>If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or you can get help directly by contacting us at customersupport@jennycraig.com, or 1-800-JENNYCARES. Carriers are not liable
                        for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with your new number. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree
                        that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Service. If
                        you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your wireless provider.</p>
                    <p>We collect various information on our behalf from and about you, including information you directly provide when you use the messaging service (the “Service”). When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, we and the third-party campaign
                        operator that we work with may collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information. Except to the extent required
                        by law, text messaging originator opt-in data and consent will not be shared with any third parties. </p>
                    <p>When you send messages via the Service, we will also collect your messaging history and any information included in those messages. We may also collect information about you using cookies or similar technologies. If you participate in a contest,
                        sweepstakes, research study, or email survey associated with the Messaging Service, we will collect basic contact information and any other information you choose to provide in connection with these activities. We will also collect your
                        contact information if you contact us with questions about the Messaging Service or for customer service. We use your information to deliver, analyze, maintain and support the Service. We may also use your information to enhance the Service
                        features and customize and personalize your experiences on the Service.</p>

                        personal information through or on these Forums your information can be viewed, collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in a Forum that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages

                    <p>JCR Holdings II, or third parties engaged by us, may use web beacons on some pages of this Site. A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to better understand the browsing patterns of visitors
                        to the page.</p>
                    <p>When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a website to retrieve the pixel image, information can be passed along such as the IP address of the computer that requested the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the
                        type of browser that was used, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons DO NOT pass or read personally identifiable information about you.</p>
                    <p>Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies set by trusted third parties that are used to assess the effectiveness of promotional campaigns or to optimize advertising once a user leaves a website. View your browser’s help section to determine
                        how to configure your browser to reject or manage first-party (i.e., JCR Holdings II) and/or third-party cookies. JCR Holdings II shares aggregated information collected through web beacons to vendors for which the beacon was set to determine
                        the success of marketing campaigns but does not disclose personally identifying information to these vendors.</p>
                    <p>Third-party ad servers may track anonymous website usage through web beacons on our Site and other websites. They do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users’ computers to track the activities of users
                        who view a web page that contains web beacons. Third-party ad servers may use information about your visits to this Site and other websites to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Periodically,
                        upon our request, third-party ad servers may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
